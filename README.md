# New York Times Scraper - Class Project
## by Adam Specker for GWU Coding Bootcamp Spring 2018

## Notes
* final addition of conditional to load pages if result length is left blank
* conditional to allow for input in one, both, or neither of the boundary dates
    * I think this could be streamlined some to avoid having duplicate URLs

## Assignment Instructions

## Front-End Team

* Create the layout for the design above. Feel free to use Bootstrap or to do something more customized of your own.

* Make sure to organize your code so as to have the necessary IDs.

* Incorporate text boxes for capturing User Input. Then research how to retrieve the input values in JavaScript

## Back-End Team

* Do preliminary research on the [API](http://developer.nytimes.com/article_search_v2.json).

* Register for an API Key.

* Understand what format the URL should look like to make an Article Call. (Hint: Use the API Console!!)

* Experiment with console logging various fields.

# Phase 02

## Front-End Team

* Begin creating basic click events. Register the submit button

* Create working transfers of data between the text-boxes and the backend.

* Experiment with creating content regions for where the article will go.

## Back-End Team

* Create the AJAX call needed to retrieve data then console.log all of the relevant fields.

* Incorporate various “optional parameters” (hard code these in initially).

* Take note of various “bugs” that appear with certain searches.

## All-Together

* Display the HTML content!!

# Phase 03

## Front-End Team

* Continue polishing the display of content in the HTML.

* Consider adding styling or other jQuery tricks.

* Consider using Bootswatch and/or Font Awesome to add more visual appeal

## Back-End Team

* Put in a hard-effort to deal with bugs. How can you handle missing fields?

# Phase 04

## All-Together

* Deploy your app to GitHub Pages!

* Then slack your links to your instructors + TAs
